What:		/sys/class/fpga_manager/<fpga>/state
Date:		October 2014
KernelVersion:	3.18
Contact:	Alan Tull <atull@opensource.altera.com>
Description:	Read state of fpga framework state machine as a string.
		Valid states may vary by manufacturer; superset is:
		* unknown		= can't determine state
		* power_off		= FPGA power is off
		* power_up		= FPGA reports power is up
		* reset			= FPGA held in reset state
		* firmware_request	= firmware class request in progress
		* firmware_request_err	= firmware request failed
		* write_init		= FPGA being prepared for programming
		* write_init_err	= Error while preparing FPGA for
					  programming
		* write			= FPGA ready to receive image data
		* write_err		= Error while programming
		* write_complete	= Doing post programming steps
		* write_complete_err	= Error while doing post programming
		* operating		= FPGA is programmed and operating
